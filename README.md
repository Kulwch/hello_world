# hello_world
1st repository I made on GitHub 
It's been only twi days since i decided i'd rather learn how to use Git and GitHub before going on my code learning of oop PHP. I'm now learning how to use Git and GitHub via Open Classrooms, where are free courses on that topic.
I hope using both will help me acquire new skills.
